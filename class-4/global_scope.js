//global scoped variables
//variable which are declared without using any keywords 
test_variable = "test value";
// variable declared above is global scope variable at the same time 
// it is the worst way to declare variable in JavaScript.
/**
 * Solution:
 * We should always use var or let to declare variables.
 * If we need to declare variables that won't be modified then we should use const keyword to create varibles.
